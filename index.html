<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Bio:</h2>
<p>I studied and researched in the field of Physics for most of my professional life, earninig a BS and MS degree in physics from Zhejiang university (Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China) and University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (Champaign, Illinois, USA) respectively. I then switched career and earned a master's degree in Computational Data Science from Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA) in 2019. My professional development then has been in the field of Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Natural Language Processing (NLP), and I have since worked at multiple companies focusing on providing data science and deep learning solutions to industrial and healthcare clients.</p>
<p>My current interest lies in AI-based healthcare, focusing on how to apply NLP technology to automate clinical visit flow for physicians and help them create "Time-to-Care" (see <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/prevention/clinician/ahrq-works/burnout/index.html">Physician Burnout</a>). I still harbor undying enthusiasm for Physics, following frontier research in Quantum Information, String Theory, and Material Sciences.</p>
